Class Description and Documentation :

Summary (What to do) - Write the whole code into individual files, this way we will know what libraries we would require to use, we can make up a automatic documentation given that we already documented each class on the basis of its uses.


1. Documentation of our class (in Doxygen) - 


2. Libraries used (purpose i.e, why it is used?) -

- Armadillo // A linear algebra library
- Math
- Graphics
- QtPainter // for 2D
- Qt Canvas 3D 	//for 3D


3. How will we organize our code into multiple files?
