COP290 - Assignment 3

Class Description and Documentation :



1. Documentation of our class (in Doxygen) - 

-> attached zipped folder namely - 'Documentation DrawBetter'. (Open the index.html in any browser).

2. Libraries used (purpose i.e, why it is used?) -


	1. Armadillo  
	 - A linear algebra library; it will be used to deal with the efficient classes for matrix, vectors, and similar other mathematical entities manipulation. it provides high-level syntax (API). 

	2. Math
	 - It will be used since it contains a set of functions to compute common mathematical operations and transformations. It is indeed necessary for minor mathematical calculations.

	3. Graphics
	 - A graphics library for utilizing the containing functions.

	4. Qt classes - 
	for e.g.  QtPainter (for the 2D graphic pad), Qt Canvas 3D (for 3D model manipulations), QtGui/QGuiApplication, QtCore/QDir, QtQuick/QQuickView, QtQml/QQmlEngine (for Graphic user interface methods).

	Others - and some more usual libraries that may be needed while writing actual code.



3. How will we organize our code into multiple files?

Our code will majorly contain 3 files, each one for one class, namely drawingPad, io, and drawBetter. By doing this our code will be much more readable and compatible with any other coder (hypothetically).
